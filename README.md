# memberduesproject
This project consists of two programs: csv_writer.py, which writes member information (ID, name, phone number, whether they have paid their dues, etc.) to an Excel spreadsheet, and send_reminders.py, which reads from an Excel spreadsheet and sends emails to members who have not paid their dues yet.
